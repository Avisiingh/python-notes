# Variables in Python

# A variable is a named container that holds a value. 
# It allows us to store and manipulate data throughout a program.
# Variables can store different types of values such as strings, integers, floats, and booleans.

# String Variables
first_name = "Avinash"
sports = "Cricket"
email = "avinashavs40@gmail.com"

# Displaying string variables
print(first_name)  # Output: Avinash

# Using f-strings for formatted output
print(f"Hello, {first_name}!")  # Output: Hello, Avinash!
print(f"You love {sports}.")    # Output: You love Cricket.
print(f"Your email is {email}.") # Output: Your email is avinashavs40@gmail.com.

# Integer Variable
age = 25
place = "Patna"

# Displaying integer values in a formatted way
print(f"You are {age} years old.")  # Output: You are 25 years old.
print(f"You live in {place}.")      # Output: You live in Patna.

# Float Variables
price = 10.99  # Represents a decimal number
gpa = 3.2  # Grade Point Average (GPA)

# Displaying float values
print(f"The price is ${price}.")  # Output: The price is $10.99.
print(f"Your GPA is {gpa}.")      # Output: Your GPA is 3.2.

# Boolean Variable
is_student = True  # Represents a True/False value

# Displaying boolean values
print(f"Are you a student? {is_student}")  # Output: Are you a student? True
